# Boss Drop Reward Delay

This mod adds a short delay between rewards from the teleporter drops. Since modding can increase the amount of drops to high values (such as 16 playercounts x 4 mountain shrines), the amount of drops that are produced becomes too much for the system to handle, either resulting in a long-lasting lagspike or a crash.

The configuration defaults to 0.3s, but the values can be adjusted by the user in the options menu.

You can also configure how many items can be dropped after each delay in the options menu.
